**Hey brother,**

Thanks for the Stripe secret key! I also need the **publishable key** to complete the integration.

In your Stripe Dashboard:
1. Go to **Developers → API Keys**
2. You'll see two keys:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`) ← I need this one
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`) ← Already have this ✅

Please send me the **publishable key** (the one that starts with `pk_test_`).

The publishable key is safe to use in the mobile app - it's designed to be public. The secret key (which you already sent) stays on the server only.

## What's Ready

Once I get the publishable key, I can complete:
- ✅ Stripe payment integration
- ✅ Subscription checkout flow
- ✅ Trial to paid conversion
- ✅ Plan upgrades/downgrades

## Temporary Setup

For now, I've:
1. ✅ Installed Stripe SDK
2. ✅ Created `.env` file with secret key
3. ✅ Set up database for Stripe integration

Just need that publishable key and we're good to go! 🚀
